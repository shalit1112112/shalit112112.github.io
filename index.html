                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            So far throughout the past two years. Lanna’s Snack shop has been run by its students(specifically Year 10’s), as a part of coursework for one of the subjects,enterprise. 
The snack shop is basically a lesson in which students have to learn from mistakes in order to succeed, it's a school project in which students benefit from,not only by education needs but also information for the future. 

<br></br>
Throughout this time the snack shop has had its ups and downs.But most member in the beginning where very determined and persevere through the hard torment that came.Even though throughout more time the students who stayed determnd got less and less. However somehow some managed to still stay focused on task.Without some of these very specific people the snack shop today would never survive.
<br></br>
I am going to tell you about the snack shop and one of the things I and many other people  thought  was the most important overall. Health & Safety, which is on the next page.

                        <h3 id="history" style="font-size: 2em">HISTORY</h3>
<p>
    In the past lanna’s snack shop has been run by two people, one of which a bus driver and a normal shopkeeper.They have been successful running the snack shop through thick and thin. When they ran the snack shop they went through some tough times such as changes of products to sell for being more healthy. Even through the problems selling products to students from year 1 and above, they always managed to do it. 
<br></br>

And when the school made the new school. They had to migrate to the new school(that is currently being used by primary), but there was a problem.If they were moving their shop to the other school they weren't going to able to sell for the secndary.So the school decided to make the shop run by the students of year enterprise class. And that's how we know the snack shop as it is today, from the dirty, old fridge to the plastic tray of dairy goodies upon them.

                        <h3 id="skills" style="font-size: 2em">SKILLS</h3>
<p>The students learn from this. Form this projects they learn the skills required to somewhat run a business and all the specific requirements needed to maintain its stability. Some of these requirements include things such as; ethically, publicity, key enterprising skills(eg dertimnation) and many more. An example of this would be in the video below, express how determined the snack shop was back then.</p>
