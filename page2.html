                        <p>
                            Health and safety is a real issue when its comes to lannnaâ€™s snack shop. Health and safety risks can lead to the biggest problems.Such as the publicity of the students & teachers, or the risk of contaminated food causing an outbreak disease.From the looks at the snack shop today, it seems the health and safety issues is somewhat better than in the beginning. 
                            <br></br>
            
                            They have improved by adding features such as paper bags instead of plastic and gloves. However when its comes to the snack shop using these items to reduce less of a risk it also leads to lower ethicality, using plastic disposable gloves, and having to throw one away each working day(5days a week, 3-4students working each day).

                        <p>Overall the snack shop has improved its safety and health towards the environment around itself and has been slowly becoming more ethical, it could still need more improving but for the general view of things, its not doing so bad</p>
